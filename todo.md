
## Todo

- [ ] include mirai-mod-config in release archives (update makefile)
- [ ] update version number
- [x] move the global variable "OldHomunType" out of Standard_Mod.lua and into Config.lua (after writing the new config GUI, to keep compatibility with the old Config.exe for now)
- [ ] add proper support for Homunculus S skills (need more information)

- [x] change SelectedMod.lua to use 'require' instead of 'dofile'
- [x] update [changelog.txt](changelog.txt)
- [x] write a new Config GUI (probably in wxLua)
